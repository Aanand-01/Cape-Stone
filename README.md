Predicting Airbnb Rental Price.

Airbnb is a internet marketplace for short-term home and apartment rentals. 
It allows you to, for example, rent out your home for a week while youâ€™re away, or rent out your spare bedroom to travelers. 
The company itself has grown rapidly from its founding in 2008 to a valuation near US$40 billion and is currently worth more than any hotel chain in the world.
One challenge that Airbnb hosts face is determining the optimal nightly rent price. In many areas, would-be renters are presented with a good selection of listings and can filter by criteria like price, number of bedrooms, room type, and more. Since Airbnb is a marketplace, the amount a host can charge on a nightly basis is closely linked to the dynamics of the marketplace.
